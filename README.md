# sciware-vscode-exercise

This is a repo for the "Intro to VS Code" Sciware.  It contains a Python coding exercise, consisting of two scripts:
- `generate_data.py`
- `analyze_data.py`

The exercise is to fill out sections of those scripts marked with `### YOUR CODE HERE ###`. Do your editing in VS Code to get used to its Python development features!
